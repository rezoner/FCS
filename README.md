Flat component system
===

Play with [this demo](http://rezoner.net/labs/fcs)

Now compare [bubble.js](https://github.com/rezoner/FCS/blob/master/script/entities/bubble.js) which contains a bubble entity.

versus 

Folder [components/](https://github.com/rezoner/FCS/tree/master/script/components) which contains everything this bubble does.

If you wonder why there are 41 bubbles (I count them for you) - it is because they have been added to the
`game` which is a state of `app` and can be [found here](https://github.com/rezoner/FCS/blob/master/script/app/game.js)


Don't look at other files - they are blasphemy.
